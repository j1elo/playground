JuanNM code samples
===================

These are random pieces of freely redistributable software I've worked on in the past:

- [GraphEd](https://github.com/juannm/playground/tree/master/GraphEd) (C++ with Qt Quick / QML) - mockup of a basic Graph Editor with support for dynamic creation of nodes and links, using *Qt 5.2 QML Canvas*. Works under both Desktop and Android platforms.

- [User management GUI](https://github.com/juannm/playground/tree/master/GUI_user_management) (C++ with Qt framework) - simple user management program with dynamic search and SQLite database access.

- [Distributed Shell](https://github.com/juannm/playground/tree/master/distributed_shell) (ANSI C) - a simple implementation of a distributed shell where commands and files are accessed through the network.

- [Bayes Network implementation](https://github.com/juannm/playground/tree/master/bayes_network) (ANSI C) - training of a Bayesian Network by means of a genetic programming algorithm.

- [Rules-based tree learning algorithm](https://github.com/juannm/playground/tree/master/rules_learning) (LISP) - rule simplification system and usage of ID3 decision trees.
